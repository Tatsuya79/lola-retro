# Lola Retro

**A CRT shader for RetroArch that simulates the whole analog chain, not just scanlines.**

`console video encoder → cable → TV decoder → electron beam → phosphor mask → glass`

Games from the CRT era were drawn for that chain. Dithered waterfalls turned translucent on composite,
1-pixel stripes became rainbow shimmer, PlayStation's 4×4 dither melted into smooth gradients.
On an LCD you only see the raw pixels. Lola Retro brings the rest back.

Named after Lola, my retriever. Retro because it is retro.

<sub>Same frame, same tube, different cable. On composite the striped background blends into soft colour with a
little rainbow, just as it did on a living-room TV. On RGB you see the stripes the artists actually drew.</sub>

## Quick start

1. Copy `shaders/lola-retro` into RetroArch's shader folder (**Settings → Directory → Video Shaders** shows where it is).
2. Start a game, open **Quick Menu → Shaders → Load** and pick `lola-retro/curved/consumer-tv-composite.slangp`.
3. Video driver must be Vulkan, glcore, D3D11, D3D12 or Metal (the old `gl` driver does not run slang shaders).
4. HDR display? Use the same presets from `lola-retro/hdr/curved`; setup is in [HDR](shaders/lola-retro/README.md#hdr).

Default core settings are fine for most systems. The few that matter are in
[RECOMMENDED-CORES.md](shaders/lola-retro/RECOMMENDED-CORES.md).

Every preset also comes in a `flat/` version without curvature:

## Raw pixels, composite, RGB

Full-resolution RetroArch screenshots. The bottom row is a 1:1 crop of each.

**Sonic the Hedgehog (Mega Drive).** The background is drawn with 1-pixel vertical stripes. The Mega Drive's
pixel clock puts those stripes right next to the colour subcarrier, so composite turns them into blended colour
and a rainbow shimmer. RGB keeps the stripes.

How strong that rainbow was depended on the console and the TV. Early Model 1 Mega Drives had a cheap encoder
with weak filters and showed it strongly; later models and TVs with a comb filter showed much less. The default is
a typical console. Set **Luma trap in the console** to 0 for an early Model 1, or to 1 for a later model.

![Sonic: raw, composite, RGB](docs/sonic-raw-composite-rgb.jpg)

**Super Mario Bros. (NES).** Composite softens colour and lets it bleed past the edges, and the dithered side
of the pipe melts into a smooth shade. RGB stays sharp, only rounded by the beam.

## Optional: dither blend on RGB

Prefer the clean RGB picture but want the dithering blended? Turn on **Dither blend on RGB and S-Video** in the
shader parameters. It takes out only the stripes that alternate from one pixel to the next, so Sonic's background
and Mario's pipe blend without composite's rainbow and blur. It is off by default because no real TV did this;
it is modern processing, like the notch filter of the RetroTINK 4K Pro.

![Dither blend off and on, with composite for comparison](docs/dither-blend-sonic.jpg)

## Colour like the TV you had

An American TV did not decode colour by the book. Its decoder shifted the colour axes and added red gain
("red push") for warmer skin tones, so yellows leaned orange and reds were stronger, and its phosphors were
not today's sRGB colours either. The presets follow the signal: NTSC games get a US TV decoder (Sony CXA2025AS)
and SMPTE-C phosphors, PAL games a standard decoder and EBU phosphors. In this frame the lavender sky turns blue
and the bricks turn orange-red through the US TV decoder.

![Standard decoder and US TV decoder](docs/tv-colour-us-vs-pal.jpg)

## PC monitor, in millimetres

A PC monitor was not a TV. It ran at 31 kHz, drew 320×200 games twice (400 lines), and its beam and dot mask were
much finer. The PC Monitor preset describes a typical mid-90s 15-inch monitor the way its spec sheet would:
14-inch picture, 0.28 mm dot mask, a beam spot of 0.30–0.45 mm. Every mode follows from that one tube:
320×200 gives chunky pixels with fine lines you only see up close, 640×480 is sharp enough for 1-pixel dots,
and 1024×768 is a little soft, as it really was on a 15-inch screen.

![PC monitor at 320x200, 640x480 and 1024x768](docs/pc-monitor-modes.jpg)

The Amiga 1084S preset is built the same way, from the monitor's service manual: 0.42 mm slot mask, 6.5 MHz
amplifier, D65 white, and the whole picture with a black border around it. Because its beam is described in
millimetres, NTSC games (200 lines, further apart) show stronger lines than PAL games (256 lines), as on the
real monitor. The beam was calibrated on a photo of a real 1084S.

![The same text on the 1084S in PAL and NTSC](docs/amiga-1084s-pal-ntsc.jpg)

## Amiberry

The Amiga 1084S preset also comes as GLSL for [Amiberry](https://amiberry.com), the stand-alone Amiga
emulator: copy [`amiberry/lola-retro`](amiberry/lola-retro) into Amiberry's shader folder and choose
`lola-retro/amiga-1084s.glslp`. Same picture as in RetroArch; setup and settings in its [README](amiberry/lola-retro/README.md).

![Cannon Fodder and Super Stardust AGA in Amiberry with the 1084S preset](docs/amiberry-1084s.jpg)

<sub>Amiberry with the 1084S preset: Cannon Fodder (PAL) and Super Stardust (AGA). The dithering stays visible as a
fine texture, the lines show in darker areas, and the picture sits in the black border of the real monitor.</sub>

## 86Box

The PC monitor preset also comes as GLSL for [86Box](https://86box.net), the PC emulator: with the OpenGL
renderer, add `86box/lola-retro/pc-monitor-vga.glslp` in **View → Renderer options…**. Same picture as in
RetroArch, from text mode and 320×200 up to 1024×768; setup and settings in its [README](86box/lola-retro/README.md).

## What is simulated

- **Composite and RF signal.** RGB is encoded to YUV and QAM-modulated onto the 3.58 MHz (NTSC) or 4.43 MHz (PAL)
  subcarrier, with each console's real pixel clock and subcarrier phase per line and per field.
  SNES (227⅓ cycles per line) crawls diagonally, Mega Drive (exactly 228) stands still, PlayStation (227½) flips every line.
- **The TV's decoder.** A luma trap or a 2-line comb filter, narrow consumer chroma bandwidth, PAL delay line,
  automatic gain and colour control, and the TV knobs (sharpness, colour, tint, brightness, contrast).
- **S-Video and RGB** skip the parts of that chain they skipped in real life.
- **Electron beam.** Each line is a spot whose width grows with brightness, in both directions and per colour gun.
  Bright detail merges and rounds off, dark detail stays sharp. Interlaced fields alternate; VGA 200-line modes are drawn twice.
- **Phosphor mask.** Aperture grille (with Trinitron damper wires), slot mask, shadow mask, or a projection screen.
- **Monitors in millimetres.** PC monitors (31 kHz) and the Amiga 1084S use a tube described in millimetres (size,
  mask pitch, beam spot on dark and on white, larger in the corners), so 320×200, 640×480, 800×600 and 1024×768 each
  look as they did on a 15-inch monitor, and NTSC Amiga games show stronger lines than PAL ones.
- **Colour of the TV.** US and Japanese TVs demodulate with "red push" (axes and gains from the Sony CXA2025AS
  datasheet), PAL TVs by the standard; phosphors are SMPTE-C, EBU or Japanese P22 instead of sRGB.
- **Glass.** Curvature, halation, white point (6500–9300 K), vignette, room reflection, misconvergence, afterglow.
- **Internal resolution.** PS1 and PS2 cores running at 2× and up are read as blocks of one console pixel,
  so the signal stays right and the extra detail only makes edges smoother.
- **HDR output.** On an HDR display the phosphor dots and scanline centres get the brightness a real tube
  had, instead of being squeezed under the SDR white level. The `hdr` presets write HDR10 themselves.

## Tested against test patterns

The chain is checked with measured patterns, not only by eye.

**NTSC test patterns** ([patterns.wrwetzel.com](https://patterns.wrwetzel.com)). On composite the fine vertical
stripes and checkerboards turn into rainbow, and the resolution wedge shows colour where the lines get close to the
subcarrier. RGB shows none of that. Colour bars come out the same on every cable.

![NTSC test patterns](docs/ntsc-patterns.jpg)

**[240p Test Suite](https://junkerhq.net/240p/) on the Mega Drive.** Colour Bleed (1-pixel stripes) and
Checkerboard, the two patterns that show what composite does to a Mega Drive. On composite the white stripes become
a full rainbow and the coloured ones beat against the subcarrier. On SNES the same test gives a much weaker rainbow,
because its pixel clock puts the stripes further from the subcarrier. Nothing in the shader is tuned for this;
it follows from each console's real timing.

![240p Test Suite, Mega Drive](docs/240p-suite-mega-drive.jpg)

**PC monitor.** The same patch of glass in four PC modes: 1-pixel stripes both ways and a 30% grey area. In
320×200 the stripes are fully resolved and the lines show in the grey; by 1024×768 the stripes have almost
merged, as they did on a 15-inch tube, whose beam spot was about 1.6 pixels wide at that resolution.

![PC monitor test patterns](docs/pc-monitor-patterns.jpg)

A Windows 95 dialog in 640×480: text stays sharp and the dotted focus rectangle around Cancel keeps its
dots, the way photos of real VGA monitors show it.

![Windows 95 dialog on the PC monitor](docs/pc-monitor-dialog.jpg)

Measured on synthetic patterns:

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| 75% colour bars, every cable, NTSC and PAL | within about 2/255 of the source |
| Alternating lines (light output) | 0.4996 of white, 0.5 expected: the beam conserves energy |
| Composite at the subcarrier (3.58 MHz) | luma notched out, the energy shows up as colour (the rainbow) |
| Comb filter and S-Video | no false colour |
| RGB bandwidth | about 6.5 MHz, like a consumer TV's video amplifier |
| PC monitor, 320×200 to 1024×768 | spot width, 1-pixel stripe contrast, line structure and brightness within 2% of the physics |
| Amiga 1084S | line contrast inside text matched to a photo of a real monitor; NTSC 40%, PAL 27% in the same text |
